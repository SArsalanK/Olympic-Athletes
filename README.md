Olympic Athletes - OCS - Android Developer Assessment

Hi, 

I have used MVP design pattern for the development of this app. The main screen shows the list of all athletes grouped by the games they have participated and sorted by the order of their global score(as stated in the requirements). When you click on any of the athlete, his details view shows up in a new activity. I have also added comments in the code where i found necessary. In case you have any questions please do reach out! 

Thanks for your time. 

Good day!
